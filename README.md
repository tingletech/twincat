Twincat -- set up two tomcats
===============

`./grabcat.sh` will grab tomcat, and then set up two `CATALINA_BASE` directories.  Only run this once.

`./wrapper.sh appFront ./tomcat/bin/startup.sh` will start up the front end apache.
`./wrapper.sh appBack ./tomcat/bin/startup.sh` will start up the back end apache.

`appFront/webapps` and `appBack/webapps` are where you can put the `.war` files.

Project
------
Based on tomcat setup for SNAC in [eac-graph-load](https://code.google.com/p/eac-graph-load/source/browse/servers/) on google code.
